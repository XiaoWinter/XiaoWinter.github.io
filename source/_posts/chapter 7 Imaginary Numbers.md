# IMAGINARY NUMBERS

IF THE mathematical ideas dealt with in the last chapter have been a popular success, those of the present chapter have excited almost as much general attention. But their success has been of a different character, it has been what the French term *a succes de scandale*. Not only the practical man, but also men of letters and philosophers have expressed their bewilderment at the devotion of mathematicians to mysterious entities which by their very name are confessed to be imaginary. At this point it may be useful to observe that a certain type of intellect is always worrying itself and others by discussion as to the applicability of technical terms. Are the incommensurable numbers properly called numbers? are the positive and negative numbers really numbers? are the imaginary numbers imaginary, and are they numbers?— are types of such futile questions. Now it cannot be too clearly understood that, in science, technical terms are names arbitrarily assigned, like Christian names to children. There can be no question of the names being  right or wrong. They may be judicious or injudicious; for they can sometimes be so arranged as to be easy to remember, or so as to suggest relevant and important ideas. But the essential principle involved was quite clearly enunciated in Wonderland to Alice by Humpty Dumpty, when he told her, apropos of his use of words, 'I pay them extra and make them mean what I like.' So we will not bother as to whether imaginary numbers are imaginary, or as to whether they are numbers, but will take the phrase as the arbitrary name of a certain mathematical idea, which we will now endeavour to make plain.

如果上一章讨论的数学思想受到了广泛欢迎，那么本章的思想几乎同样引起了广泛的关注。但它们的成功具有不同的性质，正如法语所称的“*a succes de scandale*”。不仅实践者，连文人和哲学家们也对数学家们对神秘实体的专注感到困惑，而这些实体从其名字上看就被承认是虚幻的。在这一点上，值得注意的是，某种类型的智慧总是通过讨论技术术语的适用性而使自己和他人感到烦恼。不可计量的数字是否可以称为数字？正数和负数是否真的是数字？虚数是否是虚幻的，它们是否是数字？——这些都是此类无意义问题的例子。现在必须明确理解，在科学中，技术术语是随意赋予的名称，就像给孩子取的基督教名字一样。没有关于名称是否正确或错误的问题。它们可能是明智的或不明智的；因为有时可以安排得使其容易记住，或者以便于引出相关和重要的想法。但涉及的基本原则在《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中由亨提·邓普提向爱丽丝清楚地阐明，当他说到他使用语言时：“我给他们额外的报酬，让他们按我喜欢的方式来表达。”因此，我们不再纠结于虚数是否真的“虚幻”，或者它们是否算作数字，而是将这个短语视为某个数学概念的任意名称，我们现在将努力将其阐明。

The origin of the conception is in every way similar to that of the positive and negative numbers. In exactly the same way it is due to the three great mathematical ideas of the variable, of algebraic form, and of generalization. The positive and negative numbers arose from the consideration of equations like x+1=3, x+3=1, and the general form x+a=b. Similarly the origin of imaginary numbers is due to equation $x^2+1=3,x^2+3=1$, and $x^2+a=b$ . Exactly the same process is gone through. The equation $x^2+1=3$ becomes $x^2=2$, and this has two solutions, either $x=+\sqrt{2}$, or $x=-\sqrt{2}$. The statement that here are these alternative solutions is usually written $x=\pm\sqrt{2}$ . So far all is plain sailing, as it was in the previous case. But now an analogous difficulty arises. For the equation $x^2+3=1$ gives $x^2=-1$ and there is no positive or negative number which, when multiplied by itself, will give a negative square. Hence, of our symbols are to mean the ordinary positive or negative numbers, there is no solution to $x^2=-2$, and the equation is in fact nonsense. Thus, finally taking the general form $x^2+a=b$, we find the pair of solutions $x=\pm\sqrt{(b-a)}$, when, and only when, b is not less that a. Accordingly we cannot say unrestrictedly that the 'constants' a and b may be any members, that is , the 'constants' a and b are not, as they out to be, independent unrestricted  'variables' ; and so again a host of limitations and restrictions will accumulate round our work as we proceed.

这一观念的起源在各方面都与正数和负数的起源相似。它完全是由于三个伟大的数学思想——变量、代数形式和泛化。正数和负数是通过考虑类似于 $x + 1 = 3$、$x + 3 = 1$ 和一般形式 $x + a = b$ 的方程而产生的。类似地，虚数的起源也来自于方程 $x^2 + 1 = 3$、$x^2 + 3 = 1$ 和 $x^2 + a = b$。完全相同的过程在这里也会经历。方程 $x^2 + 1 = 3$ 转化为 $x^2 = 2$，而这有两个解，要么是 $x = +\sqrt{2}$，要么是 $x = -\sqrt{2}$。关于这些替代解的表述通常写作 $x = \pm\sqrt{2}$。到目前为止，一切都很顺利，就像在前一种情况一样。但是，现在出现了一个类似的困难。因为方程 $x^2 + 3 = 1$ 给出 $x^2 = -1$，而没有正数或负数可以与自身相乘得到负数的平方。因此，如果我们的符号意味着普通的正数或负数，$x^2 = -2$ 就没有解，实际上这个方程是无意义的。因此，最终考虑一般形式 $x^2 + a = b$，我们发现解的对是 $x = \pm\sqrt{(b-a)}$，当且仅当 $b$ 不小于 $a$。因此，我们不能不加限制地说 '常数' $a$ 和 $b$ 可以是任何成员，也就是说，'常数' $a$ 和 $b$ 并不像它们应该是的那样，是独立的无限制 '变量'；因此，随着我们工作的进行，围绕着我们的工作将累积一系列的局限和限制。

The the same task as before therefore awaits us: we must give a new interpretation to our symbols, so that the solutions $x = \pm\sqrt{(b-a)}$ for the equations $x^2 + a = b$ always have meaning. In other words, we require an interpretation of the symbols so that $\sqrt{a}$ always has meaning whether a be positive or negative. Of course, the interpretation must be such that all ordinary formal laws for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division hold good; and also it must not interfere with generality which we have attained by the use of the positive and negative numbers. In fact, it must in a sense include them as special cases. When a is negative we may write $-c^2$ for it, so that $c^2$ is positive. Then

因此，和之前一样，我们面临着同样的任务：我们必须对我们的符号给出新的解释，以便方程 $x^2 + a = b$ 的解 $x = \pm\sqrt{(b-a)}$ 始终具有意义。换句话说，我们需要对这些符号进行解释，以使得 $\sqrt{a}$ 始终具有意义，无论 $a$ 是正数还是负数。当然，这种解释必须确保所有普通的加法、减法、乘法和除法的正式法则仍然适用；同时，它也不能干扰我们通过使用正数和负数所获得的一般性。事实上，在某种意义上，它必须将它们作为特例包括在内。当 $a$ 为负数时，我们可以用 $-c^2$ 来表示它，使得 $c^2$ 是正的。然后我们有：
$$
\sqrt{a}=\sqrt{(-c^2)}=\sqrt{\left \{(-1)\times c^2  \right \} } \newline
=\sqrt{(-1)}\sqrt{c^2}=c\sqrt{-1}
$$
Hence, if we can so interpret out symbols that $\sqrt{(-1)}$ has a meaning, we have attained our object. Thus $\sqrt{(-1)}$ has come to be  looked on as the head and forefront of all the imaginary quantities.

因此，如果我们能够这样解释我们的符号，使得 $\sqrt{(-1)}$ 有意义，那么我们就达成了我们的目标。因此，$\sqrt{(-1)}$ 被视为所有虚数的开端和前沿。

This business of finding an interpretation for $\sqrt{(-1)}$ is a much tougher job that the analogous one of interpreting -1. In fact, while the easier problem was solved almost instinctively as soon as it arose, it at first hardly  red, even to the greatest mathematicians, that here a problem existed which was perhaps capable of solution. Equations like $x^2=-3$, when they arose, were simply ruled aside as nonsense.

这项为 $\sqrt{(-1)}$ 找到解释的工作比解释 -1 的类似工作要困难得多。事实上，虽然较简单的问题几乎在出现的瞬间就被直觉上解决了，但起初连最伟大的数学家们都几乎没有意识到，这里存在一个或许能够解决的问题。当方程 $x^2=-3$ 出现时，它们被简单地视为无意义而被搁置。

However, it came to be gradually perceived during the eighteenth century, and even earlier, how very convenient it would be if an interpretation could be assigned to these nonsensical symbols. Formal reasoning with these symbols was gone through, merely assuming that they obeyed the ordinary algebraic laws of transformation; and it was seen that a whole world of interesting results could be attained, if only these symbols might legitimately be used. Many mathematicians were not then very clear as to the logic of their procedure, and an idea gained ground that, in some mysterious way, symbols which mean nothing can by appropriate manipulation yield valid proofs of propositions. Nothing can be more mistaken. A symbol which has not been properly defined is not a symbol at all. It is merely a blot of ink on paper which has an easily recognized shape. Nothing can be proved by a succession of blots, except the existence of a bad pen or a careless writer. It was during this epoch that the epithet 'imaginary' came to be applied to $\sqrt{(-1)}$. What these mathematicians had really succeeded in proving were a series of hypothetical propositions, of which this is the blank form: If interpretations exist for $\sqrt{(-1)}$ and for the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of $\sqrt{(-1)}$ which make the ordinary algebraic rules (e.g. $x+y=y+x$, &c.) to be satisfied, then such and such results follows. It was natural that the mathematicians should not always appreciate the big 'If' , which ought to have preceded the statements of their results.

然而，逐渐地，人们意识到，在18世纪，甚至更早的时候，如果能为这些无意义的符号赋予解释，将是多么方便。在使用这些符号进行形式推理时，人们仅仅假设它们遵循普通的代数变换法则；并且人们看到，只要这些符号可以合法地使用，就能获得一个充满有趣结果的整体世界。许多数学家当时并不太清楚他们的程序逻辑，逐渐形成了一种观点，认为无意义的符号通过适当的操作可以产生有效的命题证明。这是极其错误的。一个未被正确定义的符号根本不是符号。它只是一种在纸上具有易于识别形状的墨水斑点。通过一系列墨水斑点，除了证明存在一个坏的钢笔或一个粗心的作者，什么也无法证明。正是在这个时代，“虚数”这一称谓开始被应用于 $\sqrt{(-1)}$。这些数学家们真正证明的，只是一系列假设性命题，其空白形式是：如果存在对 $\sqrt{(-1)}$ 及其加法、减法、乘法和除法的解释，使得普通的代数规则（例如 $x+y=y+x$ 等）成立，那么就会得出某些结果。数学家们不总是能意识到在他们结果陈述之前应该有一个重要的“如果”，这是很自然的。

As may be expected the interpretation, when found, was a much more elaborate affair than that of the negative numbers and the reader's attention must be asked for some careful preliminary explanation. We have already come across the representation of a point by two numbers. By the aid of positive and negative numbers we can now represent the position of any point in a plane by a pair of such numbers. Thus we take the pair of straight lines XOX' and YOY', at the right angles, as the 'axes' from which we start all our measurements. Lengths measured along OX and OY are positive, and measure backwards along OX' and OY' are negative. Suppose that a pair of numbers, written in order, e.g(+3,+1), so that there is a first number (+3 in the above example), and a second number (+1 in the above example), represents measurements form O along XOX' for the first number, and along YOY‘ for the second number. Thus (cf. Fig. 9) in (+3,+1) a length of 3 units is be measured along XOX' in the positive direction, that is from O towards X, and a length +1 measured along YOY' in the positive direction, that is from O towards Y. Similarly in (-3,+1) the length of 3 units is to be measured from O towards X', and of 1 unit from O towards Y. Also in (-3,-1) the two length are to be measured along OX' and OY' respectively, and in (+3,-1) along OX and OY' respectively. Let us for the moment call such a pair of numbers an 'ordered couple'. Then, from the two numbers 1 and 3, eight ordered couples can be generated, namely

正如预期的那样，当解释被发现时，它比负数的解释要复杂得多，读者的注意力必须集中在一些细致的初步解释上。我们已经遇到过用两个数字表示一个点。借助正数和负数，我们现在可以通过一对这样的数字来表示平面上任意一点的位置。因此，我们取两条相互垂直的直线 XOX' 和 YOY'，作为我们进行所有测量的‘坐标轴’。沿 OX 和 OY 测量的长度为正，沿 OX' 和 OY' 反向测量的长度为负。假设一对数字按顺序书写，例如 (+3,+1)，其中第一个数字是 (+3)，第二个数字是 (+1)，它们分别表示沿 XOX' 从 O 开始的第一个数字和沿 YOY' 的第二个数字的测量。因此（参见图 9），在 (+3,+1) 中，沿 XOX' 的正方向测量 3 个单位的长度，也就是从 O 向 X 方向延伸，而沿 YOY' 的正方向测量 1 个单位的长度，也就是从 O 向 Y 方向延伸。同样，在 (-3,+1) 中，长度 3 个单位的测量是从 O 向 X' 方向延伸，1 个单位是从 O 向 Y 方向延伸。在 (-3,-1) 中，这两个长度分别沿 OX' 和 OY' 测量，而在 (+3,-1) 中，分别沿 OX 和 OY' 测量。暂时将这样的一对数字称为‘有序对’。然后，从数字 1 和 3，可以生成八个有序对，即
$$
(+1,+3),(-1,+3),(-1,-3),(+1,-3),  \\
(+3,+1),(-3,+1),(-3,-1),(+3,-1)
$$
Each of these eight 'ordered couples' directs a process of measurement along XOX' and YOY' which is different form that directed by any of the others.

这八个‘有序对’各自引导着沿 XOX' 和 YOY' 进行不同的测量过程，这与其他任何一个有序对所指引的过程都是不同的。

![image-20241105222323503](https://typora-huang-cong.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/image-20241105222323503.png)

The processes of measurement represented by the last four ordered couples, mentioned above, are given pictorially in the figure. The lengths $OM$ and $ON$ together correspond to (+3,+1), OM' and $ON$ together correspond to (-3,+1), $OM'$ and $ON'$ together to (-3,-1), and $OM$ and $ON'$ together to (+3,-1). But by completing the various rectangles, it is easy to see that the point $P$ completely determines and is determined by the ordered couple (+3,+1), the point $P'$ by (-3,+1), the pint $P''$ by (-3,-1), and the point $P'''$ by (+3,-1). More generally in the previous figure (8), the point $P$ corresponds to the ordered couple $(x,y)$, where x and y in the figure are both assumed to be positive, the point $P'$ corresponds to $(x',y)$, where x' in the figure is assumed to be negative, $P''$ to $(x',y')$, and $P'''$ to $(x,y')$. Thus an ordered couple $(x,y)$, where x and y are any positive or negative numbers, and the corresponding point reciprocally determine each other. It is convenient to introduce some names at this juncture. In the ordered couple $(x, y)$ the first number x is called the 'abscissa' of the corresponding point, and the second number y is called the 'ordinate' of the point, and the two numbers together are called the 'co-ordinates' of the point. The idea of determining the position of a point by its 'co-ordinates' was by no means new when the theory of 'imaginaries' was being formed. It was due to Descartes, the great French mathematician and philosopher, and appears in his *Discours* published at Leyden in A.D. 1673. The idea of the ordered couple as a thing on its own account is of later growth and is the outcome of the efforts to interpret imaginaries in the most abstract way possible.

上述提到的最后四个有序对所代表的测量过程在图中以图示的形式呈现。长度 $OM$ 和 $ON$ 一起对应于 (+3,+1)，$OM'$ 和 $ON$ 一起对应于 (-3,+1)，$OM'$ 和 $ON'$ 一起对应于 (-3,-1)，$OM$ 和 $ON'$ 一起对应于 (+3,-1)。但通过完成各种矩形，可以很容易看出，点 $P$ 完全由有序对 (+3,+1) 确定，同时也由它来确定；点 $P'$ 由有序对 (-3,+1) 确定；点 $P''$ 由有序对 (-3,-1) 确定；点 $P'''$ 由有序对 (+3,-1) 确定。更一般地，在前面的图（8）中，点 $P$ 对应于有序对 $(x,y)$，其中图中的 $x$ 和 $y$ 都假设为正数，点 $P'$ 对应于 $(x',y)$，其中图中的 $x'$ 假设为负数，点 $P''$ 对应于 $(x',y')$，点 $P'''$ 对应于 $(x,y')$。因此，有序对 $(x,y)$，其中 $x$ 和 $y$ 可以是任何正数或负数，及其对应的点是相互决定的。此时，引入一些术语是很方便的。在有序对 $(x,y)$ 中，第一个数 $x$ 被称为对应点的“横坐标”，第二个数 $y$ 被称为点的“纵坐标”，而这两个数一起被称为点的“坐标”。通过“坐标”来确定点的位置的思想，在“虚数”理论形成时绝不是新的。它源自伟大的法国数学家和哲学家笛卡尔，并出现在他于公元1673年在莱顿出版的《话语》一书中。作为一个独立概念的有序对的思想则是后来的发展，是对虚数进行最抽象解释的努力的结果。

It may be noticed as a further illustration of this idea of the ordered couple , that the point $M$ in fig.9 is the couple (+3,0), the point $N$ is the couple (0,+1), the point $M'$ the couple (-3,0), the point $N'$ the couple (0,-1), the point $O$ the couple (0,0).

可以注意到，作为有序对这一概念的进一步说明，图9中的点 $M$ 是有序对 (+3,0)，点 $N$ 是有序对 (0,+1)，点 $M'$ 是有序对 (-3,0)，点 $N'$ 是有序对 (0,-1)，点 $O$ 是有序对 (0,0)。

Another way of representing the ordered couple $(x,y)$ is to think of it as representing the dotted line $OP$ (cf.Fig.8), rather than the point $P$. Thus the ordered couple represents a line drawn from an 'origin', $O$, of a certain length and in a certain direction. The line $OP$ may be called the vector line form $O$ to $P$, or the step from $O$ to $P$. We see, therefore, that we have in this chapter only extended the interpretation which we gave formerly of the positive and negative numbers. This method of representation by vectors is very useful when we consider the meaning to be assigned to the operations of the addition and multiplication of ordered couples.

另一种表示有序对 $(x,y)$ 的方式是将其看作代表虚线 $OP$（参见图8），而不是点 $P$。因此，有序对表示的是从某个“原点” $O$ 开始，按一定的长度和方向绘制的线段。线段 $OP$ 可以称为从 $O$ 到 $P$ 的向量线，或者称为从 $O$ 到 $P$ 的步长。因此，我们可以看到，在这一章中，我们只是扩展了之前对正数和负数的解释。通过向量表示法来表示有序对在我们考虑加法和乘法运算的意义时非常有用。

We will now go on to this question, and ask what meaning we shall find it convenient to assign to the addition of the two ordered couples $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$. The interpretation must, (a) make the result of addition to be another ordered couple, (b) make the operation commutative so that $(x,y)+ (x',y') = (x',y')+(x,y)$ , (c) make the operation associative so that

我们现在继续讨论这个问题，并询问我们会为两个有序对 $(x, y)$ 和 $(x', y')$ 的加法赋予什么样的意义。这个解释必须满足：(a) 使加法的结果是另一个有序对，(b) 使加法运算满足交换律，即 $(x,y)+ (x',y') = (x',y')+(x,y)$，(c) 使加法运算满足结合律，即
$$
\left \{(x,y)+(x', y')  \right \} +(u,v) \\ = (x,y)+ \left \{ \right (x',y')+(u,v) \}
$$


(d) make the result of subtraction unique, so that when we seek to determine the unknown ordered couple $(x,y)$ so as to satisfy the equation

(d) 使减法的结果唯一，以便当我们试图确定未知的有序对 $(x,y)$ 时，使其满足方程。
$$
(x,y)+(a, b)=(c,d),
$$
there is one and only one answer which we can represent by

只有一个且唯一的答案，我们可以用…来表示。
$$
(x,y)=(c,d) - (a, b).
$$
All these requisites are satisfied by taking $(x,y)+ (x',y')$ to mean the ordered couple $(x+x',y+y')$ . Accordingly, by definition we put

通过将 $(x,y) + (x',y')$ 解释为有序对 $(x+x', y+y')$，所有这些要求都得到了满足。因此，根据定义，我们定义为：
$$
(x,y)+ (x',y')=(x+x',y+y')
$$
Notice that here we have adopted the mathematical habit of using the same symbol + in different senses. The + on the left-hand side of the equation has the new meaning of + which we are just defining; while the two +'s on the right-hand side have the meaning of the addition of positive and negative numbers (operations) which was defined in the last chapter. No practical confusion arises from this double use.

请注意，在这里我们采用了数学中的惯例，使用相同的符号“+”表示不同的含义。方程左边的“+”具有我们刚刚定义的新含义；而右边的两个“+”则表示上一章中定义的正数和负数的加法运算（操作）。这种双重使用不会引起实际的混淆。

As examples of addition we have

作为加法的例子，我们有：
$$
(+3,+1)+(+2,+6) = (+5,+7), \\ (+3,-1)+(-2,-6)=(+1,-7),\\(+3,+1)+(-3,-1)=(0,0).
$$
The meaning of subtraction is now settled for us . We find that 

减法的意义现在已经为我们确定。我们发现,
$$
(x,y)-(u,v)=(x-u,y-v)
$$
Thus
$$
(+3,+3)-(+1,+1) = (+2,+1),
$$
and
$$
(+1,-2)-(+2,-4)=(-1,+2)
$$
and
$$
(-1,-2)-(+2,+3)=(-3,-5)

$$
It is easy to see that

很容易看出，
$$
(x,y)-(u,v)=(x,y)+(-u,-v)
$$
Also
$$
(x,y)-(x,y)=(0,0)
$$
Hence (0,0) is to be looked on as the zero ordered couple. For example

因此，(0,0) 应被视为零有序对。例如，
$$
(x,y)+(0,0)=(x,y)
$$
The pictorial representation of the addition of ordered couples is surprisingly easy.

有序对加法的图示表示出奇地简单。

![image-20241105222403104](https://typora-huang-cong.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/image-20241105222403104.png)

Let $OP$ represent $(x,y)$ so that $OM=x$ and $PM=y$; let $OQ$ represent $(x_{1} ,y_{1})$ so that $OM_1=x_1$ and $QM_1=y_1$ . Complete the parallelogram $OPRQ$ by the dotted lines $PR$ and $QR$ , the diagonal $OR$ is the ordered couple $(x+x_1, y+y_1)$. For draw $PS$ parallel to $OX$ ; then evidently the triangles $OQM_1$  and $PRS$ are in all respects equal. Hence $MM'=PS=x_1$ , and $RS=QM_1$; and therefore

设 $OP$ 代表有序对 $(x,y)$，使得 $OM=x$ 且 $PM=y$；设 $OQ$ 代表有序对 $(x_1, y_1)$，使得 $OM_1=x_1$ 且 $QM_1=y_1$。通过虚线 $PR$ 和 $QR$ 完成平行四边形 $OPRQ$，对角线 $OR$ 是有序对 $(x+x_1, y+y_1)$。然后画出与 $OX$ 平行的 $PS$；显然，三角形 $OQM_1$ 和 $PRS$ 在所有方面是相等的。因此，$MM' = PS = x_1$，且 $RS = QM_1$；因此，
$$
OM'=OM+MM'=x+x_1, \\ RM'=SM'+RS=y+y_1.
$$
Thus $OR$ represents the ordered couple as required. This figure can also be drawn with $OP$ and $OQ$ in other quadrants.

因此，$OR$ 代表了按要求的有序对。这个图形也可以在其他象限中绘制，其中 $OP$ 和 $OQ$ 位于不同的象限。

It is at once obvious that we have here come back to the parallelogram law, which was mentioned in Chapter 6, in the laws of motion, as applying to velocities and forces. It will be remembered that, if $OP$ and $OQ$ represent two velocities, a particle is said to be moving with a velocity equal to the two velocities added together if it be moving with the velocity $OR$ . In other words $OR$ is said to be the resultant of the two velocities $OP$ and $OQ$. Again forces acting at a point of a body can be represented by lines just as velocities can be; and the same parallelogram law holds, namely , that the resultant of the two forces $OP$ and $OQ$ is the force represented by the diagonal $OR$. It follows that we can look on an ordered couple as representing a velocity or a force, and the rule which we have just given for the addition of ordered couples then represents the fundamental laws of mechanics for the addition of forces and velocities. One of the most fascinating characteristics of mathematics is the surprising way in which the ideas and results of different parts of the subject dovetail into each other. During the discussions of this and the previous chapter we have been guided merely by the most abstract of pure mathematical considerations; and yet at the end of them we have been led back to the most fundamental of all the laws of nature, laws which have to be in the mind of every engineer as he designs an engine and of every naval architect as he calculates the stability of a ship. It is no paradox to say that in our most theoretical moods we may be nearest to our most practical applications.

立刻可以看出，我们这里已经回到了平行四边形法则，这个法则在第六章的运动定律中有提到，适用于速度和力。我们还记得，如果 $OP$ 和 $OQ$ 代表两个速度，则当一个粒子以速度 $OR$ 运动时，我们可以说它的速度等于两个速度相加的结果。换句话说，$OR$ 被称为两个速度 $OP$ 和 $OQ$ 的合速度。同样，作用于物体某一点的力也可以用线段表示，就像速度一样；并且相同的平行四边形法则成立，即两个力 $OP$ 和 $OQ$ 的合力是由对角线 $OR$ 代表的力。因此，我们可以把有序对看作代表速度或力，而我们刚才给出的有序对相加规则则代表了力和速度加法的基本力学定律。数学最迷人的特点之一是，不同部分的思想和结果出乎意料地互相契合。在本章和上一章的讨论中，我们仅仅受到最抽象的纯数学考虑的指导；然而，在讨论的结尾，我们却回到了最基本的自然法则，这些法则每个工程师在设计机器时都必须牢记，每个船舶设计师在计算船舶稳定性时也必须牢记。说在我们最理论的思维模式下，我们可能最接近于实际应用，这并不是悖论。
